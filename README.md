# Final-Project
This repository includes all materials for the final project for BIO539.

CSV files:

  template_qPCR.csv - this file contains the template that should be used for all subsequent experiments using the R code written for this project. Lines may be added or removed, but the order of controls should remain the same.
  
  raw_data_qpcr.csv - this file contains the raw data used to generate figures 1 and 2 in the R markdown file.
  
  raw_data_qpcr2.csv - this file contains the raw data used to generate figure 3 in the R markdown file.
  
  
R files:

  final_project_normalized_to_control_gene.R - this file contains the code that should be used for all analyses that need to compare based on control genes. The first 4 lines of this file include instructions on which lines may need to be updated based on treatment and gene names.
  
  final_project_normalized_to_treatment.R - this file contains the code that should be used for all analyses that need to compare based on treatment. The first 4 lines of this file include instructions on which lines may need to be updated based on treatment and gene names.


Rmarkdown file:

  Analysis_of_qPCR_data_final_project.Rmd - this file contains the exploratory analysis of preliminary qPCR data, along with verification that the code could be applied to different datasets.
 
 
Word file:

 Trautmann_Final_Project_paper.doc - this file contains a brief paper to explain the work that was done to generate the data for this analysis, as well as a detailed description of how the calculations were completed.
